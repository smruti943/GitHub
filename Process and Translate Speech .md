Azure Cognitive Services provides a robust machine learning and artificial intelligence-based services for speech translation in real time.

In this service we leared about voice synthesizing. The speech service from Azure has speech sythesis process which use artificail inteligence to translate human voice in to text speech. Text to speech is another tool which produce human like sound from text,which is amazing.With speech service combining we can make a set of vocal tracts or voices to use

4.Delivering intuitive bots or assistants

We started with Creating the Speech Service resources on Azure.Speech resource created in Azure with required details.Subscription keys and endpoint were noted.After that we moved to create Synthesize speech to audio output with availabe C# code. We followed the instruction and able to convert audio file to text formart.Later with Synthesize speech to an audio file ,we were able to convert speech text to an audio file.Text-to-speech from the Speech service enables the applications, tools, or devices to convert text into human-like synthesized speech.
