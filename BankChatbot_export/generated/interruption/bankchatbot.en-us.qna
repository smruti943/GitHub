We encourage you to use your virtual assistant TISA , which you can find in the "Contact and help" section in TESTBank.   If you want to talk to our specialist, you can write to us on the chat or call the hotline. However, the waiting time for the connection may be longer than usual, because we work temporarily in a limited team to ensure the health and safety of our employees.  Between 10:00 and 13:00 the most customers call and write to us, so if you can, choose another time of contact. Please be patient and understanding.  If possible, postpone visits to the branch until later, most banking matters can be settled via online banking and a mobile application.
